			"When I was young, I don't really like anime because in my eyes it makes the people watching it act weird.
			I could't understand why people<br>would watch something so "<i>childish</i>" and "<i>immature</i>" like that, 
			I thought to myself that I wouldn't watch it. But then I found my uncle<br>watching an anime titled "<b>Hunter X Hunter</b>",
			an anime about kid following his dreams to becoming a hunter like his dad.<br>
			<br>
			I have started to watch the same anime in secret, slowly I started to love it and embrace this culture. After that I talked 
			about my classmates<br>that time about my experience and I was looking for more, since then and until now I still watch anime at my free time."<br>
