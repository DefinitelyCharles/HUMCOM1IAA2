				<h4>
					<span class = "tab2"></span><b>What is music?</b>
				</h4>
				
				<p class = "content">
					<span class = "tab3"></span>Vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) combined 
					in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, <br>
					<span class = "tab2"></span>and expression of emotion.
				</p>
				
				<h4>
					<span class = "tab2"></span><b>Why do I like this?</b>
				</h4>
				
				<p class = "content">
					<span class = "tab3"></span>Music is an art. Beauty can be heard and it makes you feel a certain way. For me, 
					the reason I love music<br><span class = "tab2"></span>is because of this reason, the beauty of sounds 
					expression emotions and feelings through the use of instruments <br>
					<span class = "tab2"></span>or vocals that people make.
				</p>
				
				<h4>
					<span class = "tab2"></span><b>My personal favorites?</b>
				</h4>
				
				<p class = "content">
					<span class = "tab3"></span>My favorite song of all time is Creep by Radiohead, the emotions I feel 
					everytime I hear it speaks to me. The <br><span class = "tab2"></span>longing for something you want
					but you can't have it, it hurts. When you wanted love and affection but instead what <br>
					<span class = "tab2"></span>they returned was judgement of your character because of how you're different 
					from them. I often sing this song<br><span class = "tab2"></span>when I feel disappointed at myself and 
					whenever sing this song, I sing it would often find myself singing this song<br><span class = "tab2"></span>
					with an intense desire to sing about how I feel until I feel better.
					<br><br>
					<span class = "tab3"></span>My favorite band, suprisingly, is not Radiohead but Nirvana. They are the 
					one band that inspired and motivated<br><span class = "tab2"></span>me to know music more. They tought
					me so many things, how to sing with passion, not being afraid to be different, <br><span class = "tab2"></span>
					be confident of yourself even if others put you down, appreciate simplicity than complexity and more.

					<span class = "tab1"></span>Games

				<h4>
					<span class = "tab2"></span><b>What is game?</b>
				</h4>
				
				<p class = "content">
					<span class = "tab3"></span>A form of play or sport, especially a competitive 
					one played according to rules and decided by skill, <br>
					<span class = "tab2"></span>strength, or luck.
				</p>
				
				<h4>
					<span class = "tab2"></span><b>Why do I like this?</b>
				</h4>
				
				<p class = "content">
					<span class = "tab3"></span>Game is an art. Experiencing another world through playing is a different experience 
					than reality. The<br><span class = "tab2"></span>difference is that, in game you can be anything that you are 
					not in reality. Games make you feel you can be best<br><span class = "tab2"></span>than others, you can be 
					different from how you really are, you can feel special, you can do anything you want. <br>
					<span class = "tab2"></span>Feeling that, you are having excitement, curiousity and more is what makes game feel 
					so good.
				</p>
				
				<h4>
					<span class = "tab2"></span><b>My personal favorites?</b>
				</h4>
				
				<p class = "content">
					<span class = "tab3"></span>My favorite game of all time is Minecraft, the endless possiblity of what you can do
					in game is so cool. You can<br><span class = "tab2"></span>do anything there, build a kingdom, make it functional, 
					create contraptions, tell a story using those. Some say that it is a<br><span class = "tab2"></span>child's game 
					for having such aesthetic but it can be said to other games too, it just depends if you enjoy it or no. For me
					<br><span class = "tab2"></span>I loved the game since I was a young child and having a chance to grow up playing 
					it is such an awesome experience.
					<br><br>
					<span class = "tab3"></span>My most played game is League of Legends, time I have spent with my friends in this game
					are irreplacable fun<br><span class = "tab2"></span>times, that I sometimes wish I can go back to. Others may have 
					said that this game is the most toxic game and has the<br><span class = "tab2"></span>most toxic community but games
					are suppose to be enjoyed and if thats how they enjoy playing it then it's not bad but <br><span class = "tab2"></span>
					it's bad to ruin others fun. For me, having fun is if you spend those moments with your friends. Most of my friends 
					<br><span class = "tab2"></span>were playing this game so I joined them.

					<span class = "tab1"></span>Anime
				</h3>
				
				<h4>
					<span class = "tab2"></span><b>What is anime?</b>
				</h4>
				
				<p class = "content">
					<span class = "tab3"></span>A style of Japanese film and television animation, 
					typically aimed at adults as well as children.
				</p>
				
				<h4>
					<span class = "tab2"></span><b>Why do I like this?</b>
				</h4>
				
				<p class = "content">
					<span class = "tab3"></span>Anime is an art. Stories being told is like you are being involved, anime makes it so that
					the story is animated.<br><span class = "tab2"></span>A journey about pirates, love, fighting giant robots, anime most
					likely has it all. Countless stories being told this way<br><span class = "tab2"></span>is just astounding to me.
				</p>
				
				<h4>
					<span class = "tab2"></span><b>My personal favorites?</b>
				</h4>
				
				<p class = "content">
					<span class = "tab3"></span>My favorite anime of all time is Your Lie in April. This anime has changed my view how I should
					see the world, <br><span class = "tab2"></span>how I see love works, how life can be in the most unexpected ways, and it 
					inspired me to play music to the point I<br><span class = "tab2"></span>asked for a keyboard/piano but I was given a guitar. 
					Because of this anime, I'm a sucker for a story with tragedy, a<br><span class = "tab2"></span>love that isn't suppose to 
					happen so something sad happens.
