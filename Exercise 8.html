						<td>As a wild youth, elementary school student Shouya Ishida sought to beat boredom
						in the cruelest ways. When the deaf Shouko Nishimiya transfers into his class, Shouya and the rest of his class 
						thoughtlessly bully her for fun. However, when her mother notifies the school, he is singled out and blamed 
						for everything done to her. With Shouko transferring out of the school, Shouya is left at the mercy of his classmates. 
						He is heartlessly ostracized all throughout elementary and middle school, while teachers turn a blind eye. Now in his
						third year of high school, Shouya is still plagued by his wrongdoings as a young boy. Sincerely regretting his past actions,
						he sets out on a journey of redemption: to meet Shouko once more and make amends.
						Koe no Katachi tells the heartwarming tale of Shouya's reunion with Shouko and his honest attempts to redeem himself, all while
						being continually haunted by the shadows of his past.</td>

						<td>The aloof protagonist: a bookworm who is deeply detached from the world he resides in. He has no interest in others
						and is firmly convinced that nobody has any interest in him either. His story begins when he stumbles across a handwritten book, 
						titled "Living with Dying." He soon identifies it as a secret diary belonging to his popular, bubbly classmate Sakura Yamauchi. 
						She then confides in him about the pancreatic disease she is suffering from and that her time left is finite. Only her family 
						knows about her terminal illness; not even her best friends are aware. Despite this revelation, he shows zero sympathy for her
						plight, but caught in the waves of Sakura's persistent buoyancy, he eventually concedes to accompanying her for her remaining days.
						As the pair of polar opposites interact, their connection strengthens, interweaving through their choices made with each passing day.
						Her apparent nonchalance and unpredictability disrupts the protagonist's impassive flow of life, gradually opening his heart as he
						discovers and embraces the true meaning of living.</td>

						<td>Mitsuha Miyamizu, a high school girl, yearns to live the life of a boy in the bustling city of Tokyo—a dream that stands in

						Mitsuha's life in the humble countryside. In pursuit of an answer to this strange phenomenon, they begin to search for one another.
						Kimi no Na wa. revolves around Mitsuha and Taki's actions, which begin to have a dramatic impact on each other's lives, weaving them

						<td>Tokyo is currently experiencing rain showers that seem to disrupt the usual pace of everyone living there to no end. 
						Amidst this seemingly eternal downpour arrives the runaway high school student Hodaka Morishima, who struggles to financially 
						support himself—ending up with a job at a small-time publisher. At the same time, the orphaned Hina Amano also strives to find 
						work to sustain herself and her younger brother. Both fates intertwine when Hodaka attempts to rescue Hina from shady men, 
						deciding to run away together. Subsequently, Hodaka discovers that Hina has a strange yet astounding power: the ability to 
						call out the sun whenever she prays for it. With Tokyo's unusual weather in mind, Hodaka sees the potential of this ability. 
						He suggests that Hina should become a "sunshine girl"—someone who will clear the sky for people when they need it the most.
						Things begin looking up for them at first. However, it is common knowledge that power always comes with a hefty price...</td>
